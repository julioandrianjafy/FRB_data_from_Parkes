# Basic Python scripts to dedisperse FRB filterbank data 
## We will use the [FRB archival data](https://data-portal.hpc.swin.edu.au/dataset/parkes-frbs-archival-data) from the Parkes radio telescope as an example 
Assuming that we do not know the dispersion measure of the signal, we will perfom simple DM trials to maximize the pulse S/N
